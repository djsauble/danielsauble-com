  <h3>Code</h3>

  Some side projects I've worked on.

  <a href="/">My personal website</a> is an Astro site.
  I deploy it to an S3 bucket on AWS using GitHub Actions, with CloudFront as my CDN.

  In 2020, I built a recommendation engine for software packages.
  I worked on it as the capstone project for my Master's program at the Harvard Extension School.
  Package Picker was hosted on AWS ECS using Docker containers, using GitHub Actions as our CI/CD,
  Terraform to provision our infrastructure, Django as the web application framework, and
  Elasticsearch as our recommendation engine.

  In 2016, I built <a href="/runbudget">Run Budget</a>, a progressive training
  tool for runners. I'd just bought an Apple Watch and wanted to gain some experience
  with Swift and watchOS. It went through a few iterations, ranging from an
  automatic route generator to a training log that helped you increase mileage safely.
