# API Keys

New Relic One is an observability platform, which means it allows for you to get
data into and out of the platform. To do this programmatically requires API keys,
of which we have several types that are managed in several different places in 
the UI. After a large product release in June 2020, we realized we'd inadvertently
broken the ability for our users to create new REST API keys. This served as a 
catalyst to create a unified UI where you could manage all of your API keys. I 
was asked to design this new experience.

I started by identifying the personas and user stories for the project. I then 
constructed a basic mental model for the lifecycle of API keys. In general, API 
keys are created and then used in code. They are then (rarely) updated, and then 
(even more rarely) deleted.

To facilitate each step in the lifecycle of an API key, I constructed a workflow
to let users comfortably achieve each task.

With these workflows in place, I was then able to string together a set of 
wireframes representing the UI to interact with each step along the workflows.
At this level of fidelity I was able to get stakeholder feedback and make any 
needed adjustments before moving to the final step of high fidelity mocks.

List API keys.

Create an API key.

Update an API key.

Delete an API key.

Thanks to an excellent design pattern library, building these high fidelity 
mocks was not difficult. This let me focus on the unique aspects of the design,
in particular a right-rail used to show contextual help, describing the 
different types of keys available. I added this in response to stakeholder 
feedback that combining all key types into the same UI was likely to exacerbate
the degree to which our users found the different key types confusing.

Once the high fidelity mocks were ready, I took the final step of conducting 
research to uncover any lurking usability issues prior to implementation. We
verified that users found the different key types confusing, and additionally 
uncovered the following issues:

1. A couple users didn't notice the "Create key" button until we pointed it out
   to them, indicating that it should be positioned closer to the table itself.
2. A couple users were confused why the Insights and Admin keys weren't part
   of the table. This was an unfortunate limitation of where we're at in our 
   key migration process. Some key types aren't supported by our unified key
   management service yet.
3. People expressed concern about being able to find keys in the table after 
   creating them. We addressed this in the design by highlighting rows in the
   table pertaining to newly created keys, and showing a toast in the upper-right
   hand corner of the screen to let people know that the key was copied to their
   clipboard.
4. When updating or deleting a key, users wanted to be absolutely certain they 
   were updating the right one. To address this, we added additional metadata
   fields to those modals to help users cross-reference.
5. Users wanted to be able to see which keys they had deleted, and possibly
   undelete them if they made a mistake. We opted to not take action on this, 
   partly because recreating a key is not a difficult task, and also because 
   it is rare that people delete a key, so the value/effort tradeoff wasn't
   worth it to us.

The great thing about this project is that we went from an idea to a completely
validated idea very quickly. Because I was working mostly solo, I could move
quickly and get feedback from stakeholders and users as needed, as opposed to 
having a bunch of external dependencies requiring me to start and stop frequently.

I also had great success in escalating some of the out-of-scope feedback items
to product management. Our VP of Product Management is looking at how we can 
reduce the number of key types to make key management in New Relic easier overall.
