# Package Filtering

## The Problem

Supply chain security is a huge problem in OSS. The great things about OSS,
code reuse and modularity, can be taken advantage of to infect large numbers
of applications with a single well-placed supply chain attack.

For example, in npm, it's not uncommon for an application with a couple dozen
top level dependencies to pull in hundreds or thousands of transitive
dependencies via the install process. For web apps, about 97% of the code is
pulled in this way, so it&rsquo;s almost impossible for developers to know the
true surface area of the code in their applications.

The security team at npm does the hard work of implicating bad packages, so we
know which packages are bad and why. However, we didn't have a way to keep
these bad packages from being installed by an unsuspecting developer.

## The Solution

The typical developer workflow is to create a package.json file where they
define their top level dependencies. When <code>npm install</code> is run, npm
constructs the dependency tree and fetches all packages (as tarballs) from the
configured upstream registry.

One of these upstream registries is npm Enterprise, our private package hosting
solution. Because this product is typically purchased by large companies, there
are three personas to consider:

- The <strong>npm developer</strong> who runs <code>npm install</code> and
  searches for packages, but doesn't think about security or administer the
  services their tools are pointed at.
- The <strong>npm Enterprise admin</strong> who is responsible for making sure
  developers are productive and configuring the tools those developers depend
  upon.
- The <strong>security team</strong> who is responsible for keeping the company
  and its assets safe from external attacks, which includes setting security
  policy that developers are expected to comply with.
- The <strong>CTO or engineering manager</strong> who purchases npm Enterprise
  based on cost, what it claims to do, and on the recommendation of team
  members.

We discovered that developers don't want to be blocked, so any solution needs
to make it obvious why a package was blocked, and easy to find appropriate
replacement packages. The npm Enterprise admins need an easy way to set
security policy dictated to them by the security team. The security team needs
a way to enforce policy so they don't have to spend time verifying manual
compliance, which is very time consuming. Finally, the CTO or engineering
manager wants a tool that makes their developers happy and is from a company
they trust.

We built a story map which illustrates these needs, alongside the development
journey and the accompanying stories.

Many competitors in this space have overly complicated policy settings that are
difficult to understand and use, so we kept our initial MVP to just three
settings:

1. Block all packages with vulnerabilities
2. Block packages with critical vulnerabilities
3. Allow all packages

To meet the needs of the npm Enterprise admin, we built a new admin section in
npm Enterprise that lets people configure package filtering.

<img src={PackageFilteringAdminImg} alt="package filtering admin UI" />

After setting a blocking policy, developer could no longer install those
packages. To make it obvious what was going on, we let the npm Enterprise admin
set a custom message to display in the terminal whenever packages were blocked.

<img src={PolicyViolationsImg} alt="terminal showing a blocked package" />

However, this is only half of a solution. The reason most security products are
despised by developers is because they're built for security teams, not
developers who have very different needs. Blocking a package means a potential
security problem was averted, but it doesn't help developers find a replacement
so they can get their work done.

To address this problem, we wanted to have the npm CLI automatically choose a
package version that doesn't violate policy. This way, a developer could just
run `npm install`, get a replacement package for the one that was
blocked, and be on their way.

To achieve this, we had to make the npm CLI aware of which packages were good,
and which were bad. We modified the packument (a JSON object returned by the
registry with information about a package, including what version are
available) by moving any bad packages to a separate list of "blocked" versions.

Now, the CLI could look at the the list of available versions (now all allowed
by policy), and choose the best one. And since we kept the blocked packages in
the packument, it could also tell the difference between a package that was not
found, and a package that was blocked. A nice side effect of this approach is
that legacy versions of the CLI would still work, even though they would lose
the ability to distinguish between the blocked and not found cases.

With these changes in place, developers would have a much more pleasant
experience. For example, suppose a developer tried installing a specific bad
version of lodash.

```
$ npm install lodash@1.3.1
```

They would get a blocked message, as before:

```
npm ERR! code E403 npm ERR! 403 Could not download lodash@1.3.1 due to policy
violations. npm ERR! 403 Use `npm audit fix` to upgrade this dependency. npm
ERR! 403 npm ERR! 403 In most cases you or one of your dependencies are
requesting npm ERR! 403 a package version that is forbidden by your security
policy npm ERR! 403 please contact your npme admin. npm ERR! A complete log of
this run can be found in: npm ERR!
`/Users/admin/.npm/_logs/2019-08-09T20_46_04_225Z-debug.log`
```

But now they can ask for a list of versions that are allowed by policy:

```
$ npm view lodash versions
```

And the resulting list gave them all the information they needed to choose a
better alternative.

```
[ '0.5.0-rc.1', '1.0.0-rc.1', '1.0.0-rc.2', '1.0.0-rc.3', '4.17.12',
'4.17.13', '4.17.14', '4.17.15' ]
```

In fact, they could simply ask for the latest, and npm would automatically
install the latest verion of lodash allowed by policy.

```
$ npm install lodash npm WARN tmp@1.0.0 No description npm WARN tmp@1.0.0 No
repository field. + lodash@4.17.15 added 1 package from 2 contributors and
audited 1 package in 0.463s found 0 vulnerabilities
```

This was obviously a very CLI-focused design problem, with just a very simple
GUI for configuration, but it's a great example of the importance of not
getting in the way of developers.

We also intend to build a remediation workflow that addresses the problem where
there is no easy upgrade page to address a vulnerability. Sometimes a package
isn't actually a security risk, because it is internally facing, or
misclassified, or isn't used in a way that will exercise the vulnerability.
Providing developers with the ability to request an exemption will make this
even better.
