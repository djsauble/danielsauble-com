## Side Projects

Some side projects I've worked on.

<Link to="/">My personal website</Link> is a Gatsby site with MDX (Markdown + React) for
templating and components. I deploy it to an S3 bucket on AWS using GitHub Actions,
with CloudFront as my CDN.

In 2020, I built a recommendation engine for software packages.
I worked on it as the capstone project for my Master's program at the Harvard Extension School.
Package Picker was hosted on AWS ECS using Docker containers, using GitHub Actions as our CI/CD,
Terraform to provision our infrastructure, Django as the web application framework, and
Elasticsearch as our recommendation engine.

In 2016, I built <Link to="/runbudget">Run Budget</Link>, a progressive training
tool for runners. I'd just bought an Apple Watch and wanted to gain some experience
with Swift and watchOS. It went through a few iterations, ranging from an
automatic route generator to a training log that helped you increase mileage safely.
