# Daniel Sauble

Product Designer and Software Developer with a background in tech startups.

## Experience

### Lead Product Designer at New Relic (2020-)

I'm the sole designer for five teams in our Developer Ecosystem group. I drove
the UX and IA design for <a href="https://developer.newrelic.com" target="_blank">
developer.newrelic.com <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and our App Catalog. I
contribute PRs to fix code and styling issues. I facilitate monthly user research
projects. I contribute to design outside my group (e.g. I designed a new API key
management UI for our accounts group).

### Product Manager at npm (2019-2020)

I led product management efforts for three new features: 1) a security policy engine
for npm Enterprise, 2) an email invite feature for the public registry, and 3)
a `fund` subcommand for the npm CLI to help OSS package
maintainers inform consumers about funding opportunities. GitHub acquired npm in 2020.

### Product Owner at Sonatype (2017-2019)

I led product management efforts for three new features in Nexus Repository
Manager: 1) a new tree browser for packages, 2) updated Repository Health Check
to better identify vulnerable packages, and 3) updated Nexus Vulnerability
Scanner to make it easier for people to scan packages and get a quality report.
I used A/B testing to improve engagement with in-product educational content by 700%.

### Senior UX Developer at Sonatype (2014-2017)

I led design and front-end development efforts for Nexus Repository Manager 3.0.
I built a new drilldown UI pattern to facilitate simpler configuration flows,
rather than relying on the dense configuration panels from Nexus Repository
Manager 2.0. I led IA and front-end dev for a relaunch of Sonatype.com on Hubspot.

### UX Designer at Puppet (2011-2014)

I led UX design, research, and wrote CSS for Puppet Patch Manager 1.0. I led
design and front-end development for the Live Management server orchestration
in Puppet Enterprise 2.0. I was acting product manager for several projects.
I led research efforts at two of our annual conferences (150+ user tests). I
built and maintained a low-fidelity UI pattern library for a team of 12 designers.

## Side Projects

### Code

I actively write code for several side projects.

<Link to="/">This website</Link> is a Gatsby site with MDX (Markdown + React) for
templating and components. I deploy it to an S3 bucket on AWS using GitHub Actions,
with CloudFront as my CDN.

I'm currently building a recommendation engine for software packages. I've been
working on it since January 2020 with three teammates from my capstone project
at the Harvard Extension School. <a href="https://pkgpkr.com" target="_blank">
Package Picker <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is hosted on AWS ECS using
Docker containers, we use GitHub Actions as our CI/CD, Terraform to provision our
infrastructure, Django as the web application framework, and Elasticsearch as our
recommendation engine.

In 2016, I built <Link to="/runbudget">Run Budget</Link>, a progressive training
tool for runners. I'd just bought an Apple Watch and wanted to gain some experience
with Switch and watchOS. It went through a few incarnations, ranging from an
automatic route generator to a training log that helped you increase mileage safely.
