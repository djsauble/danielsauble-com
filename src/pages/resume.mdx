## Side Projects

### Code

I actively write code for several side projects.

<Link to="/">This website</Link> is a Gatsby site with MDX (Markdown + React) for
templating and components. I deploy it to an S3 bucket on AWS using GitHub Actions,
with CloudFront as my CDN.

I'm currently building a recommendation engine for software packages. I've been
working on it since January 2020 with three teammates from my capstone project
at the Harvard Extension School. <a href="https://pkgpkr.com" target="_blank">
Package Picker <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is hosted on AWS ECS using
Docker containers, we use GitHub Actions as our CI/CD, Terraform to provision our
infrastructure, Django as the web application framework, and Elasticsearch as our
recommendation engine.

In 2016, I built <Link to="/runbudget">Run Budget</Link>, a progressive training
tool for runners. I'd just bought an Apple Watch and wanted to gain some experience
with Switch and watchOS. It went through a few incarnations, ranging from an
automatic route generator to a training log that helped you increase mileage safely.
