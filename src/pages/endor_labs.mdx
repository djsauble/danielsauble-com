# Endor Labs

## Intro

This is a sample of work from my role as the founding product designer at Endor Labs, a dependency lifecycle management tool for software developers and application security people.
The product is a combination of a CLI which performs static call graph analysis on source code, a GitHub Action that manages how repositories are scanned, and a web UI that helps people view and prioritize findings in their code.
I owned the design of our first product from conception (March 2022) to launch (October 2022), to our first few customers (January 2023).

## Early user journey map

Very early in product development, before we had a dedicated product manager, I interviewed multiple internal stakeholders, including the co-founders, and built a map of personas, jobs to be done, and an initial set of workflows.
This helped us establish a starting baseline.

## Early conceptual prototype

Starting from the user journey map, I built out multiple iterations of a low-fidelity prototype to help us better visualize the workflows.
This level of fidelity helped facilitate internal debates about what we were trying to build, even before real data from the backend was available to feed into the design process.
We also began running discovery interviews with external folks to understand if the problem we were solving was real and what their mental models were.

## Early data viz exploration

We realized early on that a product with nothing but tables was likely to have limited utility.
As our data collection efforts continued, we began to see interesting trends, graphs, and rollups that needed to be shown in a non-tabular representation.
I began to explore different ways to visualize this data in the UI and even though these early attempts were wrong, they facilitated great discussions that helped us understand the limitations of the data (especially with regards to trends) and the feasibility of different data visualizations.

## Usability research results matrix

Throughout the development of the product, I ran discovery and usability research projects with internal and external users.
Some of the external users were design partners also interested in purchasing the product, and others were recruited from LinkedIn or userinterviews.com.

## Project and default version overview

Once a company onboards their code repositories, either by installing a GitHub app or scanning locally using our CLI, they can view the health of those repositories using our web UI.

## Project scan history with CI status

Endor Labs performs static analysis of code.
This scanned data is uploaded to our service and the history can be viewed in the UI.
Depending on how policy is configured, these scans may block the companyâ€™s CI pipeline until any violations are resolved.

## Policy configuration with Rego editor

Users can configure policy rules using either existing templates or from scratch using the Rego policy language.
We use the Monaco editor to embed a VSCode-like experience in the web UI, including a linter.
Once defined, policy rules are assigned to projects using tags.

## Finding details with call paths drawer

Findings are essentially insights about your projects.
Every finding has a type and severity associated with it, as well as a large amount of metadata.
Findings can affect a project, one of its packages, or a dependency.
Because we do static code analysis, the path to affected code is frequently known and displayed here.
Depending on policy, a finding could result in a blocked CI pipeline as well.

## Dependency graph with detail drawer

Most software projects depend on a large number of open source dependencies.
This dependency graph is used to interactively explore the graph, either starting from the package and working towards its dependencies or from one of the dependencies and working towards the package that imported it.
Additional details about any dependency can be viewed via a drawer mechanism.
