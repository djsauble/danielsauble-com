# Developer Website

New Relic One is an observability platform, which means you can build and host
custom React apps that use your data to meet specific use cases you have. We 
needed to build a website to help people get started building these custom apps.

I started by understanding the information architecture of the new site. First,
we assembled a list of page archetypes, mapping to the different types of content
we wanted to put on the site.

Once we established the archetypes, the next step was to create a mental model of 
how we expected people to traverse these different types of content. We went for a 
an approach of starting at a high level overview and quickly descending to the 
details as needed. At any level of granularity, users could choose to either go
deeper to skip to the next topic at the same level of granularity.

Finally, following this structural framework, we assembled the archetypes
into an IA diagram that would inform the development of the site and its 
navigation.

With this framework in place, we could proceed with the design and implementation 
of the site. Thanks to other sites in our portfolio, we had a partial pattern 
library to follow, so only had to design specific components. Most of my design 
effort was spent on the sidebar nav, header nav, banner, and right rail (for 
linking to related content, not pictured).

<img src={HomePageImg} alt="home page" class="border" />

As a stretch goal, we decided to support dark mode on the website. I paired with
one of our front-end developers to come up with an appropriate color palette. It 
turned out quite nicely.

<img src={HomePageDarkModeImg} alt="home page dark mode" class="border" />

Because our next project is to replatform the New Relic docs site, we wanted to
reuse components from the developer site. To achieve this, the developer team created 
a new component library project, and I worked with them to identify candidate 
components to add to the library.
