# Hi, Basecamp!

I've been looking for an opportunity to work at Basecamp for years. I'm super
stoked about this design role. Let's talk through your requirements and why I
might be the right human for the job. ðŸ™‚

## You want a generalist designer

I've worn a multitude of hats in my career: designer, researcher, front-end developer,
and product manager. I often wear multiple hats for the same project. Iâ€™ve spent five years of my career
working remotely and am accustomed to driving my own projects to completion, from requirements
gathering, to research, to design, and sometimes implementation also.

## Who designs web interfaces

At Puppet, I
was a designer for Puppet Enterprise, a web interface on top of Puppet. At npm,
I was the designer and product manager for our paid registry and npm Enterprise
offerings, both having a web interface to manage packages, security, and
user administration. At New Relic, I lead design for our application
catalog as well as our developer and documentation sites.

## Who can write code as needed

Iâ€™ve written a lot of code, mostly for prototyping purposes, but also for
production. Iâ€™m most
comfortable in Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I don't have recent experience
with Ruby or Ruby on Rails, but I've used them in the past for hobby projects. For fun,
I also dabble with machine learning and CI/CD automation. My personal website is
statically generated with Gatsby and uses MDX (Markdown + React) for templating.

## Who is good at delivery

Successful projects solve problems for users *and*
the business. I make sure we're confident that a project is valuable before doing anything resembling
design work. Once design work starts, itâ€™s important to show progress
quickly. Businesses tire quickly of projects that donâ€™t
deliver, so I scope work to ensure we deliver something meaningful
in weeks, not months. I prefer vision to roadmaps as a way of keeping people informed and excited about where we're headed.

## Who has good design sensibilities

I like a high data-to-ink ratio in my interfaces. I love simple interfaces that
efficiently break the userâ€™s problem into a series of easily-digestible steps. I 
dislike murky interfaces that use eye-candy to mask the
fact that they don't actually solve the user's problem. I design interfaces that
attract use by their usefulness, not by their mastery of gamification.

## Who has solved technical problems

In June, New Relic shipped a major new version of New Relic. Unfortunately, we
broke the ability for users to create new REST API keys. We migrated the affected
key type, but the only user interface for this service was a GraphQL API.

Our accounts group asked if I could step in and design a UI for easier management
of API keys. Working mostly by myself, I documented the personas, user stories,
mental model, required workflows, and initial low-fidelity wireframes. I vetted
these wireframes with the PM, development team, design team, and general manager
for the group and moved to high-fidelity mocks.

After a round of usability research, I discovered that users were confused by
by the many different types of API keys available to them. To address this, I
added some in-product documentation and escalated the issue to our VP of 
Product Management, who will be prioritizing an effort to reduce the number of 
API keys. The entire process took five weeks, from initial request to handoff.

Since in-product documentation is a new idea within New Relic, I met with our
UX Architect to talk through the new pattern and its rationale. We are going to
add this pattern to our design system since it solves a repeated need weâ€™ve had
to communicate complex concepts within the product itself.

## In conclusion

I love pretty much everything I've seen from Basecamp. The hard things to do 
in a startup or public company are possible for you. You can iterate until you've
shipped the right thing, you can employ flat pricing so no single customer gets
leverage over your product, and you can stay small and nimble instead of chasing
growth above all else. I've experienced the other way of doing business, I'm ready to kick ass the Basecamp way.

Thanks for taking the time!
